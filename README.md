hi guys!

really cool project we are making.🤩🤩🤩🦎🦖🦕
5 people - ryan 🦧,  michael 🦫, chaewon 🐅, divy 🐘, and brian 🦔

we created a model that can recommend (hopefully) the best song for any user inputted image. 
the usage of this model shines in situations such as posting instagram stories and posts, where users tend to pick a song to post with it.

currently, our model is trained from massive amounts of influencer posts to ensure that songs are correctly recommended to certain posts, 
this means that the songs recommended are from our database of songs that we obtained from those posts.

there will be an option that allows users to input their own SPOTIFY playlist and it will recommend the best song for an image from that playlist specifically.

i just want to be part of your symphony!!! 🌈🌈🌈🐬🐬🐬🌼🌼🌼🍉🍉🍇

yatta!💕
